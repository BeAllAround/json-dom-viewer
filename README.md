# json-viewer

Written in pure DOM, Json Viewer is a data viewer for dissecting json data.
It is inspired by the Javascript object viewer appearing in our console by either "console.log" call or simply typing out a global variable and hitting enter.

You can load as many json files as you like. It currently supports: Booleans, Numbers, Strings, Objects, and Arrays (parsed as indexed Objects). Have a look at the gif and check out its flexibility yourself!

You can use the module in your own projects by importing it or use it as a local app.
